# Intelligent Probing - IPro
IPro is based on the Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN) \cite{mestres_2017:KDN} paradigm that allows to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques in SDN. We argue that an ML-based optimization of probing frequency can keep monitoring overhead within a target value while minimizing performance degradation and providing high monitoring accuracy.
